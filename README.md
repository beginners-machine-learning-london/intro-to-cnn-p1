## Questions you will answer in this workshop

## Learning Objectives

- Learn deep learning concepts such as tensors, neural network architectures and how neural networks work.
- See model training, tuning and deployment LIVE in Jupyter notebooks!
- Learn the process of loading and preparing data for training
- Learn how to evaluate models and common pitfalls
- Experiment with TensorFlow model architecture and evaluations


## What will I learn during this workshop

## Prerequisites

While you won't need prior experience in practical machine learning or with Microsoft Azure to follow along with this class, we'll assume some familiarity with:

- Python programming language: See [Udacity - Intro to Python](https://eu.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110)

## Steps

This workshop consists of the following activities:

## Flow

1. Clone this git repository using `git clone https://github.com/beginners-machine-learning-london/intro-to-tensorflow`
2. Create an Azure account

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Make sure to shut down your Azure notebook instances and workspaces after you are done. Otherwise, you will get charged for it per hour. It will not shut down automatically. For training, you will provision a new instance, however that second instance will stop running after the training job is finished.

## Featured technologies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/): A deep learning framework by Google (used in most production environments).
- [Pytorch](https://www.pytorch.org/): A deep learning framework by Facebook (more pythonic than tensorflow)

## Dataset Source

The Fashion MNIST datasets are provided as part of the deep learning framework Tensorflow under .
