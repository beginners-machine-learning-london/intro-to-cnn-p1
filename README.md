# Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Repo for hosting workshop materials delivered on 28/02/2022

## Questions you will answer in this workshop

## Learning Objectives

- What are convolutional layers and how do Convolutional Neural Networks Work (CNNs)
- Introduction to CNN classifiers, object detectors, and Semantic Segmentation
- Learn to convert a fully dense network to a CNN in TensorFlow to improve the performance of image classifiers
- A quick look into Object detection CNNs
- Learn how to design CNNs for your AI application


## What will I learn during this workshop

## Prerequisites

In this training, we will approach the problem from the ground up. Reviewing how CNNs work without getting bogged down into the detail and getting some models training as fast as possible. The workshop materials will be delivered in a combination of coding exercises and lectures.

## Dataset Source

- The Fashion MNIST datasets are provided as part of the deep learning framework Tensorflow under the MIT license. 
- The dataset consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot. 
- The images are divided into train and test sets. The training set contains 60,000 images. The test set contains 10,000 images. 
- This dataset is used in this workshop to train a CNN.
- The images are 28x28 grayscale images. 
- The labels are one-hot encoded.
- The training set is used to train the model and The test set is used to evaluate the model.
